# Narottham Karnati — Cloud & Application Security Portfolio

This repository contains my personal security-focused portfolio. It highlights my professional experience, hands-on projects, and practical work across **Cloud Security, Application Security, and Security Automation**.

The portfolio itself is built as a modern web application to clearly present technical content, timelines, and projects in a clean, readable format.
